> **Note:** This project is in the development stage.  
> In addition to `lut-filter.py`, there are two other Python scripts in this repository that can modify your images without LUT generation:
> - [`Simple Color Shift`](src/simple-color-shift.py) — basic color shifting tool  
> - [`Brightness Contrast Adjust`](src/brightness-contrast-adjust.py) — 
> Both scripts applie a Tezza-like style to images by adjusting exposure, brightness, fade, and warmth, but in different way. It processes all images in the specified input directory and saves the adjusted images to the output directory.

### Usage

1. Place your input images in the `input_images` folder.
2. Run the script.
3. The processed images will be saved in the `output_images` folder.
